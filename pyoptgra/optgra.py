class optgra:
    """
    This class is a user defined algorithm (UDA) providing a wrapper around OPTGRA, which is written in Fortran.

    It is specifically designed for near-linear optimization problems with many constraints.
    When optimizing a problem, Optgra will first move towards satisfying the constraints,
    then move along the feasible region boundary to optimize the merit function,
    fixing constraint violations as they occur.

    For this, constraints and the merit function are linearized. Optgra will perform less well on
    very non-linear merit functions or constraints.

    Example:

    >>> import pygmo
    >>> import pyoptgra
    >>> prob = pygmo.problem(pygmo.schwefel(30))
    >>> pop = pygmo.population(prob, 1)
    >>> algo = pygmo.algorithm(pyoptgra.optgra())
    >>> pop = algo.evolve(pop)

        Initialize a wrapper instance for the OPTGRA algorithm.

        Some of the construction arguments, for example the scaling factors, depend on the dimension of the problem.
        Passing a problem with a different dimension to the instance's evolve function will result in an error.

        Some problem-specific options are deduced from the problem in the population given to the evolve function.

        Args:

            max_iterations: maximum number of total iterations
            max_correction_iterations: number of constraint correction iterations in the beginning
                If no feasible solution is found within that many iterations, Optgra aborts
            max_distance_per_iteration: maximum scaled distance traveled in each iteration
            perturbation_for_snd_order_derivatives: Used as delta for numerically computing second order errors
                of the constraints in the optimization step
            variable_scaling_factors: optional - Scaling factors for the input variables.
                If passed, must be positive and as many as there are variables
            variable_types: optional - Flags to set variables to either free (0) or fixed (1). Fixed variables
                are also called parameters in sensitivity analysis.
                If passed, must be as many flags as there are variables
            constraint_priorities: optional - lower constraint priorities are fulfilled earlier.
                During the initial constraint correction phase, only constraints with a priority at most k
                are considered in iteration k. Defaults to zero, so that all constraints are considered
                from the beginning.
            bounds_to_constraints: optional - if true (default), translate box bounds of the given problems into
                inequality constraints for optgra. Note that when also passing constraint priorities, the original
                constraints of the problem come first, followed by those derived from the lower box bounds, then those
                from the upper box bounds. Infinite bounds are ignored and not counted.
            bound_constraints_tolerance: optional - constraint tolerance for the constraints derived from bounds
            merit_function_threshold: optional - convergence threshold for merit function
            force_bounds: optional - whether to force the bounds given by the problem. If false (default), the
                fitness function might also be called with values of x that are outside of the bounds. Set to true
                if the fitness function cannot handle that.

                2 for spectral conjugate gradient method and 3 for conjugate gradient method
